//Your goal is to make the Todo App work by implementing the functionality for the components.

// It should work the following way: The user can type anything in the input form, and press enter or click the "Add Item" button to add the item to the todo list. The todo list items should display in list format. You should then finally be able to mark items as "completed" or remove them from the list. When an item is marked as completed, have it display with a line through the text and be grayed out. Each todo item should have a checkbox to mark it as complete and a delete button to remove it. The app should also show the total count of items and the count of completed items.
